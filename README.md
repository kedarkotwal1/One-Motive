# One-Motive
Android Application Developed for a client.
An application developed as a medium between donors, NGO volunteers and people in need.
Donors would donate food/books/clothes which would be picked up by volunteers which then be delivered to the people in need.
Also developed another administration purpose app for management of NGOâ€™s resources. NGO members can accept the donations. Also, they can notify other members about any events like cleanliness-drives.
